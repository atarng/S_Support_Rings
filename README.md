# Equip Bond Rings alongside Emblem Rings

This Repository is largely dedicated to improving the experience of bond rings in Fire Emblem Engage.
The goals of this project are to make it so that:
- When Emblem Ring is equipped, it does not unequip any currently assigned Bond Ring.
- When Bond Ring is equipped, it does not deselect equipped Emblem Ring. (It is also desired to continue to deselect currently equipped bondring, but, it is currently not able to do so.)
- When Bond Ring is equipped, the associated skills and stats should apply. Currently only the skill is applied.
